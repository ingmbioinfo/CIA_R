* Completed porting of the original codebase
* Fortified some functions with additional checks
* Full support enabled for SingleCellExperiment and Seurat objects
* Renamed functions in a more cohesive - and hopefully informative - manner
* Added supplementary vignettes, still at an experimental stage, to demonstrate the functionality and also check robustness of the codebase in additional scenarios
