Description: CIA (Cluster Independent Annotation) is designed to accurately 
    classify cells in scRNA-seq datasets using gene signatures. This tool 
    operates without the need for a fully annotated reference dataset or complex 
    machine learning processes. All in all, it provides a highly user-friendly 
    and practical solution for cell type annotation.
